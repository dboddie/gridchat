gridchat
========

This gridchat application is an extension to the hubfs chat of the [plan 9
public grid project](http://wiki.9gridchan.org/Hubfs_chat/index.html).

It has the following features:

- It has a GUI!
- You can start it directly on your inferno `emu` command line. It
  autoconnects to hubfs chat.
- You can set and change your nick (type + hit enter to send a proper JOIN
  notification to the chat).
- type your message and hit enter (or press that big button) to send the
  message.
- it is entirely written in inferno limbo, the binary should run on all
  inferno dis machines.

Furthermore it should also work on mobile inferno installations like [the one
of bhgv](https://github.com/bhgv/Inferno-OS_Android) (no experience yet).

Please note that **this is an unofficial application. It's created by a user
of hubfs chat, not by the creators or maintainers of hubfs chat.**
